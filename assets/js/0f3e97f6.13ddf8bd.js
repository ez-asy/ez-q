This post exists as a quick introduction to ez-q as it is now in alpha (and also as some post has to be first). \\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nEz-q aims to be a performant, scalable and, above all, simple http message queue. At time of writing we are currently at version `0.0.1-alpha.3` (catchy I know) which is a generally \\"working\\" proof of concept to illustrate the idea behind ez-q. Specifically it shows the sort of http interface and by extension intended use we are aiming for. To play with the current version please go over to [getting started](/docs/quickstart).\\n\\nEvidently ez-q is in it\'s infancy and work will be undertaken to move to a stable 1.0.0 release. To keep this on track, there are two explicit goals that should be achieved to release `1.0.0` and these will be prioritised:\\n\\n* Make ez-q actions transactional\\n* Create usable documentation\\n\\nThese goals were chosen as they will allow consumers to use e-q with confidence. Moreover, these are vague at the moment and as such will be fleshed out in other forums, likely Github as to keep discussions close to the code. \\n\\nFinally if you wish to poke around the code please visit the [ez-q source code](https://github.com/ez-asy/ez-q) as well as the [ez-q-docs](https://github.com/ez-asy/ez-q-docs), contributions will be welcome in both and, at time of writing, creating some sort of contribution guide is a priority - this will be advertised when complete. Nevertheless, please feel free to get involved and communicate, ideally via Github issues before a more formal system is implemented."}]}')}}]);
